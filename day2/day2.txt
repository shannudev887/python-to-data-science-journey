Today we will learn the data types deeply and the operators used on them.

variables - is not fixed in the memory the variables points to an object of any type
object -  object is a value of any data type, Once created it cant be changed or updated it will be stored anywhere in the memory 
with a variable pointing to itif no variable is pointing to it then it will be considerd as garbage and it will be deleted from the memory immediatelly
object is stored in this way type,value and it unique memory address.

--Numbers--

Integers:
10,2,3
isinstnace(9,int) - true

integers have a subclass of boolean as they in either of the following values (0,False) and (1,True)
isinstance for true wrt int will be true 

Floats:
floats are the numbers that will have the decimal values.
python follow IEEE 754 double-precision format (64 bits) for float values.
but the decimals for float are not precise there might be some approximation for the exact decial values we need to use the decimal.Decimal
the decimal is a module in the python.
decimal comes in the number but it in the built-in 

a = Decimal('10.23') -> this how we will create a decimal object.
when a decimal is created the isinstance will always be false for any of the built in numeric  types.

complex numbers:
complex numbers have one real and imaginary number(2+7j)


--strings--

strings are immutable once created cantbe changed if we perform or update anything to the string it will change its id that means it is getting
created freshly 

string methods:
.upper() it will make the whole string to upperccase letters
.lower() it will make the whole string to the lower case letters
.strip() it will remove any trailing space in the string
.split() it will convert the string into list object
.join() it will add the list object to string
.replce('char1','char2') will replace the char1 to the char2 parameter

interning is a python usecase if the 2 varibles points to the same str obj then python considers both the variables as the same varible or
reuses the same string

--sequences--
Lists
tuples
sets
range

--Lists--
lists are the mutable sequence data type which will have comma sepreated values.
lists can have mutliple datatypes unlike tuples.
lists are resized dynamically.

list methods:
.append(value) the given value gets added at last index of the lists
.extend(list or range()) it is used to add two lists we can use the range to create list in the particular range
.insert(i,value) the value will be inserted at the given i i.e, index
.remove(value) remove the given value
.pop(i) it will remove the value at given index or if no index is given then the last index value is removed
.clear() it will remove all the values in the list
.index(value,start,end) returns the index of the occurance for the given value(only first occurance)
.sort(reverse=True) sort the values and we can also reverse the list sorting 
.copy() copy the list to another variable
list[start:stop:step] this  is slicing we will get the list in the given start and stop value following the step(this not a method but still adding)


--Tuples--
tuples are another datatype in the sequences but unlike lists tuples are immutable(once created cannot be updated).
tuples are used for the fixed sequences and they are faster than llists
tuples cant hold multiple data types
tuples are immutable thats why they dont have lots of methods

.count(value) it will count the no.of occurance of the value in the tuple
.index(value,start,end) it will find the value return the index of the given value and also we can give the start and end desired index


--sets--
sets are mutable sequences and they carry any index.
They are unordered and they dont carry duplicates.

set methods:
.add(value) adds an element at the end of the set
.update(sequnece/range function) this will add the elements of the sequence and we can also use the range functions
.remove(value) this can be used to remove the value an if that value is not present in the set it will give key error
.discard(value) this will remove the value if present and it will not give any error when the given element is not given
.pop() it will remove the random value from the list
.clear() this will clears the enitre set



--dict--
dicts are the collections of key value pairs
the keys should be unique and each key will be assigned with a value
dicts can be created using different methods 

d = {} #empty dict
d = {1:"ad",2:2} this is the basic dict creation and in this type we can give the numeric keys directly
d = dict("name":"shannu") this type does not allow directly to give the numeric keys but we can give the list of tuples and list for the numeric keys
i.e, d = dict([(1,"shannu),(2,"name)]) or d = dict([[1,"shannu],[2,"name]]) 


--operators--

arithmetic operators: 

This type of operators are used to perform numberic calculation between numeric types and in some cased booleans(1 or 0)
'+' -- addition
'-' -- subtraction
'*' -- multiplication
'/' -- divison
'//' -- divison to get integer value always floor
'%  -- it will give the reminder after the divison
'**' -- exponent(2^2)

assignment operators:

This type of operators are used to assigning the values as well in the incrimenting or decrementing the values

'=' -- assign a obj to variable
'+=' -- increment the value or adding the value and then assigning it to the same varible
'-=' -- decrement the value or subtration of the value and then assigning it to the same variable
similarly the remaining arithmetic operators can be used in the same way to perform the operation and assign the value to the same variable


comparison operators:

This type are used to compare or check the relation between the two values

'==' equals to 
"!=" not equals to
">"  greater than 
"<"  less than 
">=" greater than or equals to 
"<=" less than or equals to

logical operators:

'and' - both vaules or ture then only true
'or' - both values or false then only false
'not - negates the result

Bitwise operators:
Operator  Name        Example         Binary Result        

`&`       AND         `5 & 3` → `1`   `0101 & 0011 = 0001` 
`         `           OR              `5                   
`^`       XOR         `5 ^ 3` → `6`   `0101 ^ 0011 = 0110` 
`~`       NOT         `~5` → `-6`     Flips bits           
`<<`      Left Shift  `5 << 1` → `10` Shifts bits left     
`>>`      Right Shift `5 >> 1` → `2`  Shifts bits right    

Membership operators:

checks if a value is a part of other value or not and returns a boolean value

'in' 
'not in'

identity operators:

This type of operators are used to if the two values are refered to same value or not 

'is' 
'is not'
