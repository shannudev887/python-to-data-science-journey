--control flow--

control flow helps you to understand how to control the working of a python program.
we can control the execution, logic, validation and iteration in the control flow.

control flow / flow control consists of the following:

conditional statements:

conditional statements allow the program to make decision based on the conditions given
we can use the comparison operators as well as the logical operators
as the python works on the indentation every conditional blocks are indentend with logic inside that should be executed when the given condition
is true based on the given condition

the following are the conditional statements-
if:
elif:/elseif()
else:

we can use the not or ~ to make the false condition work 
we can use the if,elif and else in a sequence. if the first condition is not ture then then elif will executed and all the elifs are not true
then the else condition will be executed
we can also write the if else condition in one liner like this "value if condition else value"


looping:

loops are used to run a code block for the desired no.of iterations
loops either run for the given no.of time or until the desired condition is achieved

there are 2 types in the loops-

for loop-

for loop is used to iterate through the sequence, index of the given sequence and the range function.
the loop will end after the sequence end or the given range of values
we can use an else statement to print a statement for example
we can use the continue to skip the exection of the code block inside using if condition and break inside a if condition to stop if the condition 
is true.
we can also use the pass statement which is a no-operation statement it used syntactically requried
we can use the pass when ever the function is empty or class is empty and we have to run the code

while loop-

while loops are used to run a code block until a condition that is implemented inside the loop gets the desired output or it depend upon the 
code block execution. 
the loop will exectue only when the condition is true and it will run until the condition is false
after every iteration the condition is checked if the condition is achieved then the loop will stop running
we can use the continue,break and pass in the while loops aswell
there is no do while loop in the python but we can use the true and give the condition and check at the last of the iteration.
do while is used to run the code atleast once before checking the condition this will be helpful in taking the user inputs.
