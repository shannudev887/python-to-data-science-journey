Data types(Built in):

Text - str(string) - "hello"
Numeric - int,float,complex - 9, 4.6, 5+2j
Sequence -  list,tuple,range - [1,2,3], (1,2), range(2)
Mapping - dict - {1:'a',2:'g'}
Set - set,frozenset - {1,2,4}
Boolean - bool - True,False
NoneType - None - None


Mutable vs Immutable:

Mutable(data types that can be changed) - list,dict,set
Immutable(data types that cannot be changed) - str,tuple,int,float


learned all the inbuilt datatypes in the python and also thier useful methods and built in functions for the different functionalities
